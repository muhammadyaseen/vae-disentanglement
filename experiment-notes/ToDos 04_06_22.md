- [x] Check 50 epochs trained network
	- [x] Check Recon and KLD loss behaviour
		- Seems to have converged. Recon loss only went down by 0.50 units in last 15 iters (from iter 35 to 50) and KLD loss Increased by 0.15 in that same iters
	- [ ] Check correlated behaviour
		- [ ] Didn't observed correlated dims. When perturbed, only the perturbed dim reflects change on 2nd pass. No substantial change in any other dim, diagonal structure in 4 columns
		- [ ] Only 4 dims seem to change at all. Chages in other dims are on the order of 1e-3 , 1e-4 or even smaller
		- [ ] Feature importances not very impressive / exclusive. Seem to be distributed thru out dimension except for posX
	- [x] Plot pairwise activations with color coding as in paper
		- [x] for this i'll probably first need to find responsible dims for every gen factor: Implemented GBTs to find responsible dims via feature imps
		- The (test) performance of GBT is terrible and the trends aren't as clear as mentioned in the paper
	- [ ] Latent Traversals?
