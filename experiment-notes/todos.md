	- Residual Gaussian dist parameterization
	- KL balancing coeffs
	- KL warm-up
	- Spectral reg ?
	- How BU and TD nets are treated ?
- [ ] Read VACA paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14690.pdf
- [ ] Check BUnet activations, check sigmas
- [ ] Implement CS VAE Latent layer using GNN ? Is this a good idea?

Thinking about a dataset (VACA can be helpful here)
