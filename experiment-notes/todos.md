- [ ] Read up on Isabel's group's work
- [ ] Approaching Isabel
- [x] Approacing Adrian for more in-depth info on current research and future directions he sees the group moving to in terms of topics
- [x] Writing up a formal version of current work
- [ ] Can I think more about my MDL + VAE idea as a possible project pitch to Isabel? [[Minimal Cost Latent Structure Search]]
- [ ] Checkout disent lib's datasets
	- Checked: can easily integrate MPI-toy-3d, Cars, SmallNORB datasets
	- But all these datasets are with indept latents so they don't really help in the correlated case
	- we can use them to test the loss weighting thing
	- probably need to find more managable correlated datasets. I can show results on Flow, Pendulum, and CelebA etc. but for later i'll need more
- [ ] running exp on celeba
- [ ] thinking about bits of celeba and related datasets
- [ ] related cross ent and mse loss for images
