- Good intro slides: https://sci.utah.edu/~shireen/pdfs/tutorials/Elhabian_ICA09.pdf
- We observe linearly mixed signals
- The original signals themselves come from indepenent (unlike our DAG setting) non-gaussian dists. Gaussian variables are forbidden. We don't assume that these distributions are known
- Different ways of measuring / optimizing for non-gaussianity are used.
- Mixing matrix can be assumed to be square, but this can be relaxed
- PCA uses upto 2nd order moments, ICA uses second and higher order moments
- There's no ranking of ICA components like PCA
- Two major ambiguities of ICA: (1) variances of components can't be determined (2) The order of components can't be determined
- How to model / learn the source dists ?
