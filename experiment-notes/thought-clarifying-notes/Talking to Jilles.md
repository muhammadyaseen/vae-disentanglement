### About the state of thesis

- Tell that we had 2 competing works that turned out to be basically one work i.e. DEAR and CausalVAE
- They have very similar setting but I (on VAE end) and Osman (on Causal setting end) think that it can be done better and that our formalism is clearer and sound (per Osman)
- I consulted with Osman to ask his opinion and guidance on the causal setting used in CausalVAE and he had a lot of things to say. Essentially, he also thinks that we can situate our work in a more robust setting and improve the formalism.
- I have run experiments on one of their synthetic dataset and the results look good. The causal relationship is preserved. Now I have to do more systematic experiment and also on other datasets
- Ask for seminar and / or registering? Imp to get a mental timeline. But I also want to start with Isabel that means more work so.. might backfire?

<span class="remark">At this point I feel that my experimental work is severely lacking. I should have couple of experimental runs on all the relevant datasets. Need to integrate MPI-3D, Chairs etc dataset and run experiments on them...? But they're independent.. so either I introduce correlation or use them for something else</span>

Google's `disentanglement_lib` has loaders built in for these datasets. I should use them to save time.

### About working with Isabel
- Find 3-4 of her group's papers that I like and read thru them at least in broad strokes (VACA, Algorithmic Recourse)
- When can I start and how do I get introduced to her
- PhD contract info that he might have ?
- EDA groups works on foundations and it seems that ML group works on applying those foundations at ML-scale models... My interest it feels that is somewhere in the middle. Probably also reflects in my thesis work so far.
