For all $z_i$ the associated features belong to a manifold in $\mathbb{R}^k$ . If we have $n$ nodes we want $n$ subspaces that are orthogonal to each other (pairwise orth.) in $\mathbb{R}^k$ 

This however seems to contradict the dependent nature of GNNs. Since for nodes that have parents the features are calculated as a function of features of parent nodes. How do we square this with this orth. subspaces idea ?
